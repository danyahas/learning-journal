**Command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.
**For basic navigation, there are several commands that tell you what your current or present working directory is, such as : pwd, ls, and cd.
**Now,about files,This one can sometimes be hard to get your head around but as you work through the sections it will start to make more sense. A file extension is normally a set of 2 - 4 characters after a full stop at the end of a file, which denotes what type of file it is. The following are common extensions:

1. file.exe - an executable file, or program.
2. file.txt - a plain text file.
3. file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image .
