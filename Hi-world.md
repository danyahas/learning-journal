## What's Git? 
**Git it is away to share codes with others,stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit,  Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.**

**Local Operations:Git mostly relies on local operations because most necessary information can be found in local resources. This allows for process expediency because a project’s history resides on the local disk.**

**Tracking Changes :Every single change applied to any file or directory is tracked by Git. And, as the gatekeeper, Git will always detect file corruption or loss of information in transit.**

**States:Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.**
